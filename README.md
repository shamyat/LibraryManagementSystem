# LibraryManagementSystem
Library Management System
This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in Java. It demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following classes:

LibraryItem: An abstract class representing a general library item.
PhysicalBook: A subclass of LibraryItem representing a physical book.
EBook: A subclass of LibraryItem representing an electronic book.
User: An abstract class representing a user of the library.
Student: A subclass of User representing a student.
Teacher: A subclass of User representing a teacher.
Borrowable: An interface that defines methods for borrowing and returning items.
Driver: The main class to run the program and demonstrate its functionality.

Expected Output
This output demonstrates the creation of LibraryItem objects (PhysicalBook, EBook), and the borrowing and returning of these items by User objects (Student and Teacher).
